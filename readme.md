# Software Security Engineering Assignment 1

Welcome to the first assignment of our class. In this assignment, you are required to work in groups. It is crucial to cooperate and contribute meaningfully to your team. I strongly recommend scheduling meetings to discuss and distribute the workload among your team members effectively.

## Project Setup:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If not, download them from [Node.js&#39;s official website](https://nodejs.org/).

#### Install Dependencies

* Inside the project directory, run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

#### Run the Project

* Start the project by running `npm run dev`.
* Access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Application:
This application uses a traditional login and signup system. To test the system, please create an account first, then log in using the same credentials.

## Assignment Tasks [15 points]:

To achieve full marks (15/15) in this assignment, you must complete all **four** tasks. Each task requires a combination of written documentation and modifications to the source code:

* Subtasks marked with [document] necessitate a written explanation or analysis. Your responses for these should be compiled into a document and submitted in PDF format.
* Subtasks labeled with [code] require you to implement changes directly in the source code of the project.

Ensure that your submission addresses both the documentation and coding aspects as outlined, to meet the assignment's full criteria.

### Task 1: Threat Modeling [5 points]
* **[Document] Threat Modeling using data flow diagram:** Complete a Threat Modeling for the login/signup use case. For the sake of this assignment, treat this as a single use case.
* **[Document] List possible threats:** List at least four possible attacks and indicate where they may occur according to the trust boundary.
* **[Document] List possible ways to counter these threats:** For each identified threat, provide possible countermeasures to mitigate or prevent the attack. 

### Task 2: Steal Admin password [3 points]
* **[Document] Exploit Vulnerability:** Discuss and provide an example of how a vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to steal a userâ€™s password. Provide your attack as code and reveal the Admin password. 


### Task 3: Implement Secure Authentication System [7 points]

* **[Document] Fix all possible vulnerabilities to stop the attack in Task 2:** Provide a screenshot of the code segments where you identified vulnerabilities and explain how you fixed each vulnerability. 
* **[Document] Implement defense in depth for Task 2:** Discuss your defense-in-depth and provide screenshots of the implementation. Explain how you layered multiple security mechanisms to protect the system. You need to have at least three layer of defense across client/server.
* **[Code] Secure code works:** Ensure your secure authentication system works as intended, free from identified vulnerabilities.


## Submission Instructions

To ensure a smooth submission process for this assignment, please follow the steps outlined below. This will involve combining your documentation (PDF file) with the project source code, preparing the final submission package, and uploading it to Blackboard.

### Preparing Your Submission

* **Combine Documentation and Source Code**: Ensure that your written documentation, including analyses and explanations for all [document] subtasks, is compiled into a single PDF file. The PDF file should clearly state your team name and outline the contributions made by each team member to different parts of the assignment.
* **Prepare the Source Code**: Go through your project source code to ensure all [code] subtasks are correctly implemented and commented as needed.
* **Remove node_modules Directory**: Before packaging your project, delete the node_modules directory to reduce the size of your submission. This folder can be easily regenerated by running npm install and does not need to be submitted.
* **Zip Your Project** : Create a zip file containing your project's source code (excluding the `node_modules` directory) and the PDF document. Ensure the zip file is named appropriately, preferably including your team number and the assignment number, e.g., `TeamNumber_Assignment1.zip`.
* **Submit** **to Blackboard.**
